Holt and Susan K. Laury “Classroom Games: Voluntary Provision of a Public Good,” <em>Journal of Economic Perspectives</em> 11, nos. 4, Fall (1997): 209–15, doi:<a href="https://doi.org/10.1257/jep.11.4.209">10.1257/jep.11.4.209</a>.</span><br />

</span></span> Contributions to the public pool decreased fairly rapidly after the first round when you noticed how much free-riding had occurred. Shifting rules later on didn’t do much to change the equilibrium of the game. In both sections, changing the value of a kept red card to $8 in round 5 didn’t really change the average contribution, and changing the value of a kept red card to $10 and a public red card to $2 in round 8 had diverging results. In the 8 AM section, more people contributed to the public pool; in the 9:30 section, more people kept their red cards.</p>
