# Clearest and muddiest things

Go to [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/pyOvPIbRwI8CJlKE3) and answer these three questions:

1. What was the muddiest thing from class today? What are you still wondering about?
2. What was the clearest thing from class today? 
3. What was the most exciting thing you learned?

I'll compile the questions and send out answers after class.
