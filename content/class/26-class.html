</ul>
<p>Consider this example:</p>
<ul>
<li>UDOT is considering building a new freeway that is estimated to save 100,000 hours of driving and 5 lives each year.</li>
<li>The project will require 1 million bags of asphalt ($100/bag) and 1 million hours of labor (half at
$20/hour, half at $10/hour). The construction occurs in year 0.</li>
<li>Starting in year 1, the freeway will require maintenance that will cost $18 million/year.</li>
<li>Assume the following:
<ul>
<li>Drivers estimate the value of their time at $17/hour</li>
<li>The value of a statistical life is $5 million</li>
<li>The costs and benefits of the project will last for 25 years</li>
<li>The discount rate is 4%</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Answer these questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>What is the NPV of this project? What is the benefit-cost ratio?</p></li>
<li>Use an Excel data table and a graph to show the NPV across a range of the following values. At what point does the project break even?
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Discount rate</li>
<li>Hours of driving saved</li>
<li>Value of hour</li>
<li>Lives saved</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The VSL is a statistical estimate of the amount people would be willing to pay to reduce their risk of death by 1%, extrapolated out to 100%.</p>
<p>Because VSL is an average, it has measures of uncertainty associated with it. According to academic research, there is substantial uncertainty in VSL estimates: in 2008, the <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/staticfiles/administration/pdf/Value_of_Life_Guidance_020508.pdf">NHTSA reported</a> that the 95% confidence interval for VSL ranges from $1,000,000 to $10,000,000, which represents a standard deviation of around $2,000,000. With a $5 million average, the distribution would look something like this:</p>
<p><img src="/class/26-class_files/figure-html/vsl-distribution-1.png" width="576" /></p>
<p>Use Monte Carlo simulation in Excel to estimate the NPV over 1,000 trials, varying the VSL with a mean of $5 million and a standard deviation of $2 million. What is the average NPV over all these trials? What is the probability that the NPV is greater than $0? Is this still a good project, given the uncertainty of the VSL?</p></li>

<h2 id="clearest-and-muddiest-things">Clearest and muddiest things</h2>
<p>Go to <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/pyOvPIbRwI8CJlKE3">this form</a> and answer these three questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What was the muddiest thing from class today? What are you still wondering about?</li>
<li>What was the clearest thing from class today?</li>
<li>What was the most exciting thing you learned?</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ll compile the questions and send out answers after class.</p>
