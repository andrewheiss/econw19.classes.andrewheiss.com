# International Trade Game

This game was originally developed by the international NGO Action Aid and [adapted by Dr. John Sloman from the University of the West of England](https://www.economicsnetwork.ac.uk/showcase/sloman_game).

## Results

```{r calc-results, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(pander)
library(ggstance)
library(here)

source(here("lib", "graphics.R"))

results <- tribble(
  ~section, ~team,     ~total,
  "8:00",   "A1",      10500,
  "8:00",   "A2 & B1", 38900,
  "8:00",   "C1 & C2", 33200,
  "9:30",   "A1",      15050,
  "9:30",   "B1",      16600,
  "9:30",   "C1",      17300,
  "9:30",   "C2",      15400
) %>%
  mutate(team = fct_inorder(team, ordered = TRUE) %>% fct_rev())

results_summary <- results %>%
  group_by(section, team) %>%
  summarise(`Total earnings` = sum(total)) %>%
  mutate(`% of world earnings` = `Total earnings` / sum(`Total earnings`)) %>%
  ungroup() %>% 
  arrange(desc(`% of world earnings`)) %>%
  mutate(total = `Total earnings`)
```

In the 8:00 section, two mergers happened, resulting in higher incomes for both countries. In the 9:30 section, nobody merged and the resulting society was pretty much perfectly equalâ€”no one country had an inordinate amount of the world's wealth.

```{r plot-results, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(results, aes(x = total, y = team, color = fct_rev(section))) +
  geom_pointrangeh(aes(xmin = 0, xmax = total), size = 0.75,
                   position = position_dodgev(height = 0.5)) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c(nord_dk_blue, nord_red), name = NULL,
                     guide = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Final earnings", y = NULL) +
  theme_econ(13) +
  theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "bottom") + 
  facet_wrap(~ section, scales = "free_y", ncol = 1)
```

```{r table-results-8, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
results_summary %>%
  filter(section == "8:00") %>% 
  select(Country = team, everything(), -total, -section) %>%
  mutate(`Total earnings` = scales::dollar(`Total earnings`),
         `% of world earnings` = scales::percent(`% of world earnings`)) %>%
  pandoc.table(caption = "8:00 section", justify = "lcc")
```

```{r table-results-930, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
results_summary %>%
  filter(section == "9:30") %>% 
  select(Country = team, everything(), -total, -section) %>%
  mutate(`Total earnings` = scales::dollar(`Total earnings`),
         `% of world earnings` = scales::percent(`% of world earnings`)) %>%
  pandoc.table(caption = "9:30 section", justify = "lcc")
```

## Gini coefficients

This distribution of wealth created societies with different Gini coefficients: `r results_summary %>% filter(section == "8:00") %>% pull(total) %>% ineq::Gini() %>% round(2)` in the 8:00 section and `r results_summary %>% filter(section == "9:30") %>% pull(total) %>% ineq::Gini() %>% round(2)` in the 9:30 section (almost exactly 0!)

```{r plot-gini, echo=FALSE, fig.height=8}
get_lorenz <- function(x) {
  lorenz_raw <- ineq::Lc(x)
  tibble(prop_population = lorenz_raw$p,
         prop_income = lorenz_raw$L)
}

results_gini <- results_summary %>% 
  group_by(section) %>% 
  nest() %>% 
  mutate(earnings = data %>% map(~ get_lorenz(.$`Total earnings`))) %>% 
  unnest(earnings)

ggplot(data = results_gini) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(x = prop_population,
                  ymin = prop_income,
                  ymax = prop_population,
                  fill = section), alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_line(aes(x = prop_population, y = prop_income, color = section), size = 2) +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, size = 0.5, color = "grey50") +
  labs(x = "Cumulative % of population", y = "Cumulative % of income") +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), labels = scales::percent, breaks = seq(0, 1, 0.2)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), labels = scales::percent, breaks = seq(0, 1, 0.2)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(nord_dk_blue, nord_red), guide = FALSE) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c(nord_dk_blue, nord_red), guide = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ section, ncol = 1) +
  theme_econ(13) +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank(),
        axis.line = element_line(color = "black", size = 0.25))
```


# Clearest and muddiest things

Go to [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/pyOvPIbRwI8CJlKE3) and answer these three questions:

1. What was the muddiest thing from class today? What are you still wondering about?
2. What was the clearest thing from class today? 
3. What was the most exciting thing you learned?

I'll compile the questions and send out answers after class.
