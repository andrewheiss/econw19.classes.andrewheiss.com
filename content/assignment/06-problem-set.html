<li><p>From statistical studies, we know that the supply curve for wheat in 1981 was:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
 Q_S = 1800 + 240P
 \]</span></p>
<p>where price is measured in dollars per bushel and quantities are in millions of bushels per year. These studies also indicate than in 1981 the demand curve for wheat was:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
 Q_D = 3550 - 266P
 \]</span></p>
<p>What was the market clearing price in 1981?</p></li>
<li><p>The demand for wheat has two components–domestic demand (demand by US consumers) and export demand (demand by foreign consumers). By the mid-1980s, the domestic demand for wheat had risen only slightly (due to modest increases in population and income), but export demand had fallen sharply. Export demand had dropped for several reasons. First and foremost, was the success of the Green Revolution in agriculture—developing countries like India that had been large importers of wheat became increasingly self-sufficient. On top of this, the increase in the value of the dollar against other currencies made US wheat more expensive abroad. Finally, European countries adopted protectionist policies that subsidized their own production and imposed tariff barriers against imported wheat. In 1985, for example, the demand curve for wheat was:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
 Q_D = 2580 - 194P
 \]</span></p>
<p>The supply curve was more or less the same as 1981.</p>

<p>You were just hired to be an economic analyst for a large nonprofit theater and opera house. Over the past year, the executive director of the theater has been interested in determining the market demand for theater tickets. Being of a quantitative mind, she ran a clever experiment. For one show every week, she assigned experimental prices to a pool of 250 tickets and measured how many people purchased those tickets at those prices. She collected the data in <a href="/data/ticket-demand.csv">this CSV file</a>. Your job is to use statistical and economic tools to analyze this data.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Create a scatterplot of price and quantity, with quantity along the x-axis.</li>
<li>Use regression analysis to derive an estimated demand curve for theater tickets.<span><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">You’ll need to break out R again.<br />
<br />
</span></span> How well does the model fit the data and predict price? What could you do to get a better estimate?</li>
<li>Based on the results of the regression in #2, create a formula for ticket demand that follows this structure: <span class="math inline">\(P = aQ + b\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is the coefficient, or change in quantity, and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is the y-intercept. Round <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> to nearest hundredth (0.01).</li>
<li>Assume that the equation in #3 is the actual market demand for tickets at theaters of this size and quality.<span><label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><em>Super big hint</em>: your formula should be <span class="math inline">\(P = -0.09Q + 57.89\)</span>.<br />
<br />
</span></span> What quantity of tickets would generate the greatest amount of revenue for your theater?<span><label for="sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-4" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Remember <span class="math inline">\(TR = PQ\)</span>, or TR = <span class="math inline">\(P = (-0.09Q + 57.89) Q\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(P = -0.09Q^2 + 57.89Q\)</span>, and the marginal revenue is the first derivative of the total revenue, or MR = <span class="math inline">\(P = -0.18Q + 57.89\)</span>.<br />
<br />
</span></span> What is the revenue-maximizing price?</li>
<li>How many tickets would be sold if they were priced at $30 (use the assumed market demand from #3)? How elastic are tickets at $30?<span><label for="sn-5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-5" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><em>Hint</em>: Recall that the formula for elasticity of demand is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta P} \times \frac{P}{Q}\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta P}\)</span> is the coefficient of <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> when the demand formula is written in terms of Q (i.e. if the demand is written as <span class="math inline">\(Q = -0.3P + 4\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta P}\)</span> is -0.3). You can also calculate it with Excel if you divide the change in quantity by the change in price along all the different quantities and prices.<br />
<br />
</span></span> How elastic are tickets at $50? How elastic are tickets at $15? What do all these elasticities mean? Interpret them using increments of 10%.</li>

<p>The fixed costs of running a musical performance at this theater are substantial—assume it costs $3,000 for regular upkeep of the theater, licensing and copyright arrangements, and other costs.<span><label for="sn-6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-6" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">lollllz no it doesn’t. It’s way more expensive than that. But this is a fake example, so.<br />
<br />
</span></span> There are also variable costs, like the number of playbills that need to be printed, the number of ads that need to be purchased, etc. Based on past history, your executive director has estimated that the theater’s total costs of running a show can be estimated with the equation <span class="math inline">\(TC = 0.07Q^2 + 3000\)</span>. The marginal cost—or first derivative—of this total cost formula is <span class="math inline">\(MC = 0.14Q\)</span>.</p>

<p>The market demand for pizza in Provo is given by the equation <span class="math inline">\(Q = 100 - 10P\)</span>, where Q is the number of pizzas sold per day and P is the price of a standard pizza.<span><label for="sn-10" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-10" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><em>Hint</em>: remember that a linear demand curve like this can also be expressed with P on the lefthand side, like <span class="math inline">\(P = 10 - 0.1Q\)</span>.<br />
<br />
</span></span> (Assume that all pizzas are about the same.) Assume initially that the market for pizzas in the town is competitive. All firms have the same total cost function for making pizzas: <span class="math inline">\(TC = 6Q\)</span> (and the corresponding marginal cost, or first derivative, is <span class="math inline">\(MC = 6\)</span>).</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Draw the demand curve (label it D) and the competitive supply curve (label it S).</li>

<p>Suppose long-distance trains are run by one private company named USRail. USRail has no competition for long-distance passenger travel, but is not an agency of the government.</p>
<p>The demand for long-distance train travel is given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
P = 2.1 - 0.5Q
\]</span></p>
<p>where Q is millions of passenger miles per month and P equals the price per mile charged for train travel. This demand curve means that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
TR &amp;= PQ \\
&amp; = (2.1 - 0.5Q) \times Q \\
&amp; = 2.1Q - 0.5Q^2 \\
MR &amp;= 2.1 - Q
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>The cost of long-distance trains are divided into the fixed costs of maintaining the rails and the variable costs of running more trips. Monthly total costs (in millions of dollars) are given by the equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
TC = 1.5 + 0.1Q
\]</span></p>
<p>Answer these questions (you don’t have to draw a picture, but it’ll probably be really helpful if you do):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What is the average cost per passenger mile when <span class="math inline">\(Q = 1\)</span>? When <span class="math inline">\(Q = 2\)</span>?</li>
<li>What is the marginal cost at <span class="math inline">\(Q = 1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Q = 2\)</span>?</li>
<li>The government is concerned about the lack of competition for USRail. It is considering new regulations to ensure marginal cost pricing, which is the competitive equilibrium. Calculate the number of passenger miles demanded if USRail is forced by law to set <span class="math inline">\(MC = P\)</span>.</li>
<li>What are the total profits of USRail under this law?</li>
<li>Suppose the government decided to let USRail maximize profits. How many passenger miles would be sold in that equilibrium, and what would the price be?</li>
<li>What are the profits of USRail under this policy?</li>
<li>The government, however, is aware that letting USRail behave like a monopoly means that there is a deadweight loss to society. Calculate the deadweight loss of the policy in #5.<span><label for="sn-12" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-12" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><em>Hint</em>: Remember that the demand curve represents the consumer’s willingness to pay, and that the area of a rectangle is <span class="math inline">\(\text{length} \times \text{width}\)</span> and that the area of a triangle is <span class="math inline">\(0.5 \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\)</span>.<br />
<br />
</span></span></li>
<li>Capitol Hill policy staffers, after many memos, have proposed a plan whereby the government will subsidize USRail to produce at the competitive (efficient) point. They have hired you to assess the economics of this plan. Can you come up with a subsidy that would allow USRail to operate at the efficient point? Thinking about surplus allocation, would this be preferable to allowing USRail set prices as they see fit? Why or why not?</li>
<li>Another policy favored by some staffers is to break up USRail into 8 regional rail companies. Would this be sufficient to achieve the efficient level of output?</li>
</ol>
