## Finding the cheapest cost of production

### Cost function

```{r cost-function, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
milk_costs %>%
  mutate_at(vars(-Quantity), list(~dollar)) %>% 
  pandoc.table(split.tables = Inf)
```

### Total costs

```{r costs-total, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
costs_total <- milk_costs %>%
  mutate(TFC = Spoon + Pot + Fridge,
         TVC = Milk + Sugar + `Chocolate powder`,
         TC = TFC + TVC) %>%
  select(Quantity, TFC, TVC, TC) 

costs_total %>%
  mutate_at(vars(-Quantity), list(~dollar)) %>%
  pandoc.table(split.tables = Inf)
```

If we decompose total costs into fixed and variable costs, we see that the rise in costs is driven almost entirely by increasing variable costs.

```{r costs-total-fig, echo=FALSE}
costs_total_plot <- costs_total %>%
  gather(cost_type, value, -Quantity) %>%
  mutate(cost_type = fct_inorder(cost_type))

ggplot(costs_total_plot, aes(x = Quantity, y = value, color = cost_type)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.5) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c(nord_red, nord_dk_blue, nord_green),
                     name = NULL) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 10, 2)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = dollar) + 
  labs(x = "Gallons of milk", y = "Amount") +
  theme_econ(9, axis_line = TRUE) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

### Average costs

```{r costs-average, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
tc_fun <- splinefun(costs_total$Quantity, costs_total$TC)

costs_avg <- costs_total %>%
  mutate(AFC = TFC / Quantity,
         AVC = TVC / Quantity,
         ATC = AFC + AVC,
         MC_chunk = (TC - lag(TC)) / (Quantity - lag(Quantity)),
         MC_instant = tc_fun(Quantity, deriv = 1)) %>%
  select(Quantity, TC, AFC, AVC, ATC, MC_chunk, MC_instant) 

costs_avg %>%
  mutate_at(vars(-Quantity), list(~ifelse(is.nan(.) | is.infinite(.) | is.na(.), NA, dollar(.)))) %>%
  pandoc.table(split.tables = Inf, missing = "—")

atc_fun <- approxfun(costs_avg$Quantity, costs_avg$ATC, rule = 2)
mc_atc <- uniroot(function(x) tc_fun(x, deriv = 1) - atc_fun(x), c(1, 10))

tc_points <- costs_total %>% 
  mutate(points = paste0("(", Quantity, ", ", TC, ")")) %>% 
  pull(points) %>% 
  paste(collapse = " ")
```

The optimal point on the ATC curve occurs when Q = `r round(mc_atc$root, 2)`. This is also not coincidentally where the MC curve intersects the ATC curve. The optimal price at this quantity is \$`r round(atc_fun(mc_atc$root), 2)` per gallon of milk, but the firm won't necessarily be able to set the price at that point on its own (unless it's a monopoly; and even then, they'll set it higher).

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: Because we're dealing with curves and not lines, calculating marginal values with Excel by subtracting the previous value from the current value *will not be 100% accurate*. The only way to get perfectly accurate marginal values is to use calculus to find the instantaneous derivative at exactly that point. 

```{r costs-average-fig, echo=FALSE}
costs_avg_plot <- costs_avg %>%
  select(-TC, -MC_chunk) %>%
  filter(Quantity > 0) %>% 
  gather(cost_type, value, -Quantity) %>%
  mutate(cost_type = fct_inorder(cost_type))

ggplot(costs_avg_plot, aes(x = Quantity, y = value, color = cost_type)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.5) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mc_atc$root, linetype = "dashed", color = "grey70", size = 0.5) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = atc_fun(mc_atc$root), linetype = "dashed", color = "grey70", size = 0.5) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c(nord_red, nord_dk_blue, nord_green, nord_orange),
                     name = NULL) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 10, 2)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 30, 5), labels = dollar) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 30)) +
  labs(x = "Gallons of milk", y = "Amount") +
  theme_econ(9, axis_line = TRUE) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank())
```


## Finding the optimal price and quantity

The firm's quantity decision depends on the market demand for chocolate milk. The demand curve for this market looks like this:

```{r demand-fig, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(milk_demand, aes(x = Quantity, y = Price)) + 
  geom_line(size = 1.5, color = nord_orange) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), breaks = seq(0, 10, 2)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +
  theme_econ(9, axis_line = TRUE) +
  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank())
```

With this demand curve, we can find the price and quantity that would produce the maximum revenue, assuming there were no costs to production.

```{r optimum-revenue-tbl, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
milk_revenue <- milk_demand %>%
  mutate(TR = Quantity * Price)

milk_revenue %>%
  mutate_at(vars(-Quantity), list(~ifelse(is.nan(.) | is.infinite(.) | is.na(.), NA, dollar(.)))) %>%
  pandoc.table(split.tables = Inf, missing = "—")

tr_fun <- splinefun(milk_revenue$Quantity, milk_revenue$TR)
q_optimum_tr <- optimize(tr_fun, c(1, 10), maximum = TRUE)$maximum %>% round(2)
```

The firm can maximize its revenue by producing `r q_optimum_tr` gallons of milk, which would create \$`r tr_fun(q_optimum_tr)` in revenue.

```{r optimum-revenue, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(filter(milk_revenue, Quantity > 0), aes(x = Quantity, y = TR)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.5, color = nord_yellow) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = q_optimum_tr, linetype = "dashed", color = "grey70", size = 0.5) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = tr_fun(q_optimum_tr), linetype = "dashed", color = "grey70", size = 0.5) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), breaks = seq(0, 10, 2)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), labels = dollar) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 175), xlim = c(0, 11)) +
  labs(x = "Gallons of milk", y = "Total revenue") +
  theme_econ(9, axis_line = TRUE) +
  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank())
```

However, this doesn't take into account the firm's costs. The firm's profit maximizing point is defined as $MC = MR$, so we need compare marginal costs and marginal revenues and calculate total profit (π) across all quantities of output.

**Again**, note that using chunky marginal values by subtracting previous values *won't be as accurate* as calculus-based instant marginal values.

To get correct marginal values we can find the formula for the total cost function by using Wolfram Alpha. If you make a list of all the points in the quantity and total cost columns (i.e. `(0, 20) (1, 22.6) (2, 27.8)`), you can fit a polynomial formula to those points with Wolfram Alpha.

For example, search for ["polynomial fit `r tc_points`"](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=polynomial+fit+(0,+20)+(1,+22.6)+(2,+27.8)+(3,+35.6)+(4,+46)+(5,+59)+(6,+74.6)+(7,+92.8)+(8,+113.6)+(9,+137)+(10,+163)) and you'll see that the best formula for total cost is $y = 1.3x^2 + 1.3x + 20$.

The marignal cost is the first derivative of the total cost, or $y = 2.6x + 1.3$.

To find the equation for total revenue we need to multiply the demand function by Q (or x), since the formula for total revenue is $TR = PQ$. By looking at the demand curve above, we can see that the y-intercept is 55 and the slope is −5, giving us $y = -5x + 55$. If we multiple that by x, we get a total revenue formula of $y = -5x^2 + 55x$ (or $P = -5Q^2 + 55Q$).

The marginal revenue is the first derivative of the total revenue, or $y = -10x + 55$.

We can set MR and MC equal to each other to find the optimal x (or Q) ($2.6x + 1.3 = -10x + 55$), solve for x, and then plug that x into one of the total equations to find the optimal price.

```{r marginal-revenue, include=FALSE}
milk_mr <- milk_revenue %>%
  left_join(select(costs_total, Quantity, TC), by = "Quantity") %>% 
  mutate(MR_chunk = (TR - lag(TR)) / (Quantity - lag(Quantity)),
         MR_instant = tr_fun(Quantity, deriv = 1)) %>%
  left_join(select(costs_avg, Quantity, MC_chunk, MC_instant), by = "Quantity") %>% 
  mutate(`π` = TR - TC)

profit_fun <- splinefun(milk_mr$Quantity, milk_mr$`π`)
price_fun <- approxfun(milk_mr$Quantity, milk_mr$Price, rule = 2)

mr_chunk_fun <- approxfun(milk_mr$Quantity, milk_mr$MR_chunk, rule = 2)
mc_chunk_fun <- approxfun(milk_mr$Quantity, milk_mr$MC_chunk, rule = 2)

mr_mc <- uniroot(function(x) tr_fun(x, deriv = 1) - tc_fun(x, deriv = 1), c(1, 10))
```

The point where $MC = MR$ can't be seen in the table, since it happens between 4 and 5 gallons. If the firm produces `r round(mr_mc$root, 2)` gallons of milk at a price of \$`r round(tr_fun(mr_mc$root, deriv = 1), 2)` per gallon, it will achieve its maximum profit of \$`r round(profit_fun(mr_mc$root), 2)`.

```{r mr-profit-table, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
milk_mr_optimal <- tibble(Quantity = mr_mc$root,
                          Price = price_fun(Quantity),
                          TR = Quantity * Price,
                          TC = tc_fun(Quantity),
                          MR_chunk = mr_chunk_fun(Quantity),
                          MC_chunk = mc_chunk_fun(Quantity),
                          MR_instant = tr_fun(Quantity, deriv = 1),
                          MC_instant = tc_fun(Quantity, deriv = 1),
                          `π` = profit_fun(Quantity))

milk_mr_all <- bind_rows(milk_mr, milk_mr_optimal) %>%
  arrange(Quantity)

milk_mr_all %>%
  mutate_at(vars(-Quantity), list(~ifelse(is.nan(.) | is.infinite(.) | is.na(.), NA, dollar(.)))) %>% 
  pandoc.table(split.tables = Inf, missing = "—", emphasize.strong.rows = 6)
```

\

```{r milk-mr-mc-plot, echo=FALSE}
milk_mr_mc_plot <- milk_mr %>%
  select(Quantity, MR = MR_instant, MC = MC_instant) %>%
  filter(Quantity > 0) %>%
  gather(type, value, -Quantity) %>% 
  mutate(type = fct_inorder(type))

ggplot(milk_mr_mc_plot, aes(x = Quantity, y = value, color = type)) +

  geom_vline(xintercept = mr_mc$root, linetype = "dashed", color = "grey70", size = 0.5) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = tr_fun(mr_mc$root, deriv = 1), 
             linetype = "dashed", color = "grey70", size = 0.5) +

  theme_econ(9, axis_line = TRUE) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank())
```


## Elasticity of demand

Finally, we calculated the elasticity of demand of chocolate milk. Recall the formula for elasticity:

$$
\begin{align}
\varepsilon &= -\frac{\% \text{ change in demand}}{\% \text{ change in price}} \\
 &= - \frac{\% \Delta Q}{\% \Delta P}
\end{align}
$$

Remember that $\% \Delta Q = \frac{Q_{\text{new}} - Q}{Q}$ and that $\% \Delta P = \frac{P_{\text{new}} - P}{P}$ (or just $\frac{\text{new} - \text{old}}{\text{old}}$). We can also write $Q_{\text{new}} - Q$ as $\Delta Q$, or just the change in $Q$ (and also $\Delta P$) This means we can rewrite the equation like so:

$$
\begin{align}
\varepsilon &= - \frac{\% \Delta Q}{\% \Delta P} \\
 &= - \frac{\frac{Q_{\text{new}} - Q}{Q}}{\frac{P_{\text{new}} - P}{P}} \\
 &= - \frac{\frac{\Delta Q}{Q}}{\frac{\Delta P}{P}}
\end{align}
$$

We can then simplify this huge hairy fraction by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by the inverse of the denominator, $\frac{P}{\Delta P}$:

$$
\begin{align}
\varepsilon &= - \frac{\frac{\Delta Q}{Q}}{\frac{\Delta P}{P}} \times \frac{\frac{P}{\Delta P}}{\frac{P}{\Delta P}} \\
 &= - \frac{\Delta Q}{Q} \times \frac{P}{\Delta P} \\
 &= - \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta P} \times \frac{P}{Q}
\end{align}
$$

That's the final version of the price elasticity of demand formula: $\varepsilon = - \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta P} \times \frac{P}{Q}$. Conveniently, $\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta P}$ is also the slope of the demand curve.

```{r milk-elasticies, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results="asis"}
dqdp <- milk_mr %>%
  lm(Quantity ~ Price, data = .) %>%
  tidy() %>%
  filter(term == "Price") %>%
  pull(estimate)

milk_elasticities <- milk_mr %>%
  select(Quantity, Price) %>%
  filter(Quantity > 0) %>% 
  mutate(`$\\frac{\\Delta Q}{\\Delta P}$` = dqdp,
         `$\\frac{P}{Q}$` = Price / Quantity,
         `ε` = -dqdp * (Price / Quantity))

milk_elasticities %>% 
  mutate(Price = dollar(Price)) %>% 
  pandoc.table(missing = "—")
```

Demand is elastic as long as the slope of the revenue function is positive, and demand is inelastic when the slope of revenue is negative, as seen here:

```{r plot-elasticities, echo=FALSE}
labels_horizontal <- tribble(
  ~x, ~y, ~label,
  4,  10, "Elastic",
  7,  10, "Inelastic"

labels_vertical <- tribble(
  ~x, ~y, ~label,
  1,  7, "Elastic",
  1,  1, "Inelastic"
)

plot_demand <- ggplot() +
  stat_function(fun = price_fun, aes(x = 0:10), size = 1.5, color = nord_orange) +
  geom_label(data = labels_horizontal, aes(x = x, y = y, label = label)) +

  labs(x = "Gallons of milk", y = "Total revenue", title = "Total revenue") +
  theme_econ(9, axis_line = TRUE) +
  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank())

plot_elasticity <- ggplot(milk_elasticities, aes(x = Quantity, y = `ε`)) +
